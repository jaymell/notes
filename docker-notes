## initial run of 'docker' command:

# CLIENT
cmd/docker/docker.go
	calls cobraadaptor.NewCobraAdaptor
	which parses the command, which is here:
	./api/client/network/cmd.go, which add this parser:
		newCreateCommand
./api/client/network/create.go
	newCreateCommand returns a call to runCreate
	runCreate does some network stuff
	and calls
	client.NetworkCreate, which is here:
./vendor/src/github.com/docker/engine-api/client/network_create.go
	sends POST to /networks/create
	
# SERVER
. api/server/router/network/network.go
	route defined here /networks/create calls *networkRouter.postNetworkCreate
. api/server/router/network/network_routes.go
	*networkRouter.postNetworkCreate
	calls *networkRouter.backend.CreateNetwork 

	so what is the Backend interface exactly (defined in ./api/server/router/network/backend.go)
	... in context of creating a bridge, it's here:
./vendor/src/github.com/docker/libnetwork/drivers/bridge/bridge.go
	CreateNetwork calls createNetwork
	which does a lot of shit
