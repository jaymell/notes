Permissions
. initialized with set of needs, any of which must be present in order to gain access
. permission.can()
  -- calls self.require().can()
  -- self.require passes itself (the permission) as argument to IdentityContext constructor
  -- IdentityContext.identity is g.identity
  -- IdentityContext.can() calls self.identity.can(permission)
  -- Identity.can passes itself permission.allows, which simply checks to see if the permission's needs are in the needs that the identity provides
